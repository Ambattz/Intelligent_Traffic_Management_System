# INTELLINGENT-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
In the present day to day life, vehicular traffic is increasing all over the world, especially in urban  areas. With inadequate space and funds for the construction of new roads, and the growing  imbalance between traffic demand and transportation resources; it is increasingly obvious that  countries must move beyond the traditional model of just building roads to solve traffic problems.  A traffic signal controller, as the most important part of infrastructure in smart city transportation,  is the main coordinator for the urban traffic flows. We propose an Intelligent Traffic Signaling  System capable of prioritizing congested lanes based on real-time traffic density. The system  works with cameras positioned at every lane of the intersection for the acquisition of images. These images are transmitted to a credit-card sized computer like Raspberry Pi for traffic density  calculation using computer vision techniques.
